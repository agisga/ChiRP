## About
The R package `ChiRP` is an MCMC-based implementation of **Chi**nese **R**estaurant **P**rocess (CRP) Mixtures of various regression and clustering analysis. CRP models (aka Dirichlet Process models) are a class of Bayesian nonparametric models.

## Installation

Install using `devtools` package
```
## install.packages('devtools' ) ## make sure to have devtools installed 
devtools::install_github('stablemarkets/ChiRP')
library(ChiRP)
``` 

## Documentation and Examples
The companion web site at (https://stablemarkets.github.io/ChiRPsite/index.html) contains the statistical details of the model as well as several examples. 

Help documentation in `R` is also available.  After installing the package and loading it with `library()`, use `?` to access help documentation for specific functions:
```
?ChiRP::NDPMix
?ChiRP::ZDPMix
?ChiRP::PDPMix
?ChiRP::cluster_assign_mode
``` 
The help file for each function contains an example that you can run directly in your `R` session.
